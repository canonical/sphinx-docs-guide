.. _starter-pack:

The documentation starter pack
==============================

The `starter pack repository`_ provides a setup for a documentation repository that uses a Di√°taxis structure and a Canonical-like theme.

See the `Canonical starter pack`_ on Read the Docs for the output.

You can use this starter pack as a basis for your own documentation.
See the `starter pack repository ReadMe`_ for setup instructions.

The documentation starter pack
===============================

The `starter pack repository <https://github.com/canonical/starter-pack>`_ provides a setup for a documentation repository that uses a Di√°taxis structure and a Canonical-like theme.

See the `Canonical starter pack <https://canonical-starter-pack.readthedocs-hosted.com/>`_ on Read the Docs for the output.

You can use this starter pack as a basis for your own documentation.
See the `repository ReadMe <https://github.com/canonical/starter-pack>`_ for setup instructions.
